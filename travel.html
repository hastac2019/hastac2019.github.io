UBC’s bus routes 68 and 70 are available for trips between key campus locations and the UBC Bus Exchange. They are wheel-chair accessible. If you require assistance to take transit, <a href="https://www.translink.ca/en/Rider-Guide/Accessible-Transit/HandyDART.aspx">HandyDART</a>, a door-to-door shared ride service, is available. For more information, see UBC <a href="https://transportation.ubc.ca/accessibility-2/">Transportation</a>.</p>

<p>HASTAC 2019 is a scent-free zone. Signage for wayfinding is provided across campus. Look for “HASTAC 2019” and the conference logo, by Diamond Point.</p>

<p>Wheelchair access to the First Nations Longhouse is via the western door of the Longhouse at 1985 Lower Mall. There is also a ramp approach to the Longhouse at the south end of the <u>X</u>wi7<u>x</u>wa Library from 1985 West Mall. Both lead to the entrance to <u>X</u>wi7<u>x</u>wa Library at the foot of the West Mall stairway.</p>
