<h2 id="conference-theme">Conference Theme</h2>

<p>The conference will hold up and support Indigenous scholars and knowledges, centering work by Indigenous women and women of colour. It will engage how technologies are, can be, and have been decolonized. How, for instance, are extraction technologies repurposed for resurgence? Or, echoing Ellen Cushman, how do we decolonize digital archives? Equally important, how do decolonial and anti-colonial practices shape technologies and education? How, following Kimberlé Crenshaw, are such practices intersectional? How do they correspond with what Grace Dillon calls Indigenous Futurisms? And how do they foster what Eve Tuck and Wayne Yang describe as an ethic of incommensurability, unsettling not only assumptions of innocence but also discourses of reconciliation?</p>

<p>With these investments, HASTAC 2019: “Decolonizing Technologies, Reprogramming Education” invites submissions addressing topics such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Indigenous new media and infrastructures,</li>
  <li>Self-determination and data sovereignty, accountability, and consent,</li>
  <li>Racist data and biased algorithms,</li>
  <li>Land-based pedagogy and practices,</li>
  <li>Art, history, and theory as decolonial or anti-colonial practices,</li>
  <li>Decolonizing the classroom or university,</li>
  <li>Decolonial or anti-colonial approaches involving intersectional feminist, trans-feminist, critical race, and queer research methods,</li>
  <li>The roles of technologies and education in the reclamation of language, land, and water,</li>
  <li>Decolonial or anti-colonial approaches to technologies and education around the world,</li>
  <li>Everyday and radical resistance to dispossession, extraction, and appropriation,</li>
  <li>Decolonial or anti-colonial design, engineering, and computing,</li>
  <li>Alternatives to settler heteropatriarchy and institutionalized ableism in education,</li>
  <li>Unsettling or defying settler geopolitics and frontiers,</li>
  <li>Trans-Indigenous activism, networks, and knowledges, and</li>
  <li>Indigenous resurgence through technologies and education.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conference-logo">Conference Logo</h2>

<p>Musqueam (xʷməθkʷəy̓əm)  artist, Diamond Point, designed the conference <a href="assets/images/logo.png">logo</a>. She writes:</p>

<p><em>As an emerging artist, I intend to create artwork that connects the old with the new and is constantly changing the more life experience I gain. I wanted to represent that idea with this piece. I describe my artwork as contemporary because my designs are current but also respectful of traditional design elements. I wanted the logo to convey the conference’s theme, “Decolonizing Technologies, Reprogramming Education.” The Thunderbird not only represents UBC, but also represents the theme of the conference. Thunderbird is known to be highly intelligent, carries out protocol, and asserts justice into communities in need. I thought this fit well with the concept of decolonization. Within the Thunderbird design I have incorporated Coast Salish design elements in order to showcase the beautiful artwork our ancestors have created for thousands of years. In a contemporary aspect, I	decided to make the circles within Thunderbird pixelated. The circle represents the symbol of life. Today, technology has become such a big influence within day-to-day life. Technology connects all of us. In saying that, sometimes being so technologically connected can come with cautions. Thunderbird is able to protect us and give us strength moving forward for the future generations to come.</em></p>
