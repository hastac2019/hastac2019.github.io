<h2 id="code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</h2>

<p>In this place and territory, we honour our commitments to ethical relationships and rigorous exchange of ideas that further the aims and sovereignties of Indigenous individuals, communities, and nations and the goals of “Decolonizing Technologies, Reprogramming Education.” As the host committee, we are seeking to create a space that is free from harassment and violence, physical or otherwise. We ask for your support in this, and we take our direction from the First Nations House of Learning’s <a href="https://fnis.arts.ubc.ca/community/first-nations-house-of-learning/">mandate</a>, which follows the Longhouse Teachings of Respect, Relationships, Responsibility, and Reverence. All of this is in keeping with longstanding protocols, relationships, and commitments established here. We hope attendees come with a generous spirit, a deep sense of ethics, and a genuine enthusiasm for the work we will all be doing together.</p>

<h2 id="salishan-catering">Salishan Catering</h2>

<p>All catering at HASTAC 2019 is provided in the First Nations Longhouse by <a href="https://salishancatering.com/">Salishan Catering</a>, which began in 1993 when the owner Denise Sparrow, a citizen of the Musqueam First Nation, applied her cultural knowledge to packaging and selling salmon. The salmon business flourished and eventually transformed into a catering business when her aunt directed her to set up a food stand at a pow-wow . . . thus began Salishan Catering. Salishan fuses traditional Musqueam cultural knowledge and foods with modern foods, creating a menu unique to the catering industry in the Lower Mainland of Vancouver.</p>

<p>Salishan’s menu for HASTAC 2019 is:</p>
<ul>

They are a mobile bookstore owned and operated by Cliff and Hilary Atleo, based primarily at Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, in Tsleil-Waututh, Sḵwx̱wú7mesh, and Musqueam territories (metro Vancouver). Centered on the core belief that books should be affordable and accessible, Iron Dog Books sells new and used fiction, non-fiction, and children’s and young adult books from a 2006 Freightliner step van that has been converted to a storefront on wheels. The shop also gratefully accepts donations of secondhand books, which allow Iron Dog Books to donate 20% of the retail value to rural and remote indigenous schools in Nuu Chah Nulth territory on the west side of Vancouver Island. Cliff and Hilary write: “As indigenous people (Nuu Chah Nulth/Tsimsian and Anishinaabe/Scottish) we care deeply about our home communities and strive always to move forward in a way that benefits our people and our environment. Book ownership and reading are powerful tools for self-determination and engagement—we are so pleased that Iron Dog Books can be part of the next chapter of bookshops.”   </p>

<p>Find Iron Dog Books in / near the First Nations Longhouse from 4 to 7pm on Thursday, from 10am to 7pm on Friday, and from 10am to 5:30pm on Saturday.</p>
